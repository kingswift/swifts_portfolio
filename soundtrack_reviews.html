    <p>Views is an okay album.  I have purchased this album based off of the hype.  After listening to the album, it was definitely not worth the purchase.  There are a few good songs on the album, most notably “Weston Road Flows” , “Redemption” and “With You”.  I think Drake’s attempt at a new style ruined it for me.  I think he should have kept the same formula he used for the “Nothing Was The Same” album.  </p>

    <p>Rihanna's album Anti is a very solid album.  There are a few amazing tracks : “Yeah I Said It” , “Needed Me”,  “Sex With Me”, “Higher”, “Love On The Brain”.  In all I fully recommend purchasing this album.  This is one of Rihanna’s greatest work to date.  The beats are amazing and she has developed her own distinct sound on this album.</p>

    <p>Twenty88 is a great duo album.  Based off of some of the past work that Big Sean and Jhene Aiko have done together I knew there would be a chance for success.  Boy was I right!!! This album has a very futuristic yet throwback rap/rnb feel to it.  My favorite songs are: “Memories Faded”, “Déjà vu”, “On The Way”, “Talk Show” and “2 Minute Warning”.  This is an album I recommend to all the throwback 80’s hip hip and rnb heads.</p>
